-- This migration completes the work of two previous migrations:
--
--   * v37, where we stopped recording account lifecycle
--     events in the `eventLog` table.
--   * v38, where we stopped using the `tokenId` column
--     in the `securityEvents` table.
--
-- It's the final cleanup work that we can do now that there
-- are no old webheads running previous versions of the code.
