# Firefox Accounts DB Server, MySql Backend

MySql backend (used in production) for the [fxa-auth-db-server](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-db-server/).

## Prerequisites

* node 0.10.x or higher
* npm
* mysql

## Configuration ##

If you then set your `NODE_ENV`, then the file `config/$NODE_ENV.json` will be read in as part
of loading configuration:

```
export NODE_ENV=dev
```

In `config/config.js` you can see a set of defaults for various config options. Go take a look and
then create a new local file called `config/dev.js`. This will contain a set of values to override
the defaults. For example, if you have a password set for your MySql `root` user, you might try
something like this:

```json
{
  "master": {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "mysecret1"
  },
  "slave": {
    "user": "root",
    "password": "mysecret1"
  }
}
```

The same config is used by both the database patcher and the main server as shown below.

## Creating the Database ##

Once you have your config in place, you can create and patch the database using the
`db_patcher.js` command. Try this:

```sh
node bin/db_patcher.js
```

This should create the database (if it doesn't yet exist), and apply each patch located
in `db/schema/*.sql` in the correct order. If this command fails and can't connect to the
database, please check your mysql configuration and connectivity on the command line.

## Starting the Server ##

Once the database has been created and patched, you can start the server (keep the same `NODE_ENV`
as you had earlier):

```sh
npm start
```

Once this has started up, it will be listening on `locahost:8000` (or whatever port you have
configured in your local config file).

## Cleanup

You may want to clear the data from the database periodically. You can just drop the database
but make sure there is nothing in it that you want to keep:

```sh
mysql -u root -p -e 'DROP DATABASE fxa'
```

The server will automatically re-create it on next use.

## Docker Based Development

To run the auth db MySQL backend via Docker, three steps are required:

    $ docker build --rm -t mozilla/fxa_auth_db_mysql .
    $ docker run --rm -v $PWD:/opt/fxa mozilla/fxa_auth_db_mysql npm install
    $ docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/opt/fxa --net=host mozilla/fxa_auth_db_mysql

This method shares the codebase into the running container so that you can install npm and various modules required by package.json. It then runs FxA auth db MySQL backend in a container, while allowing you to use your IDE of choice from your normal desktop environment to develop code.
